Hardware and Software files of  IEEE publication: Soil Moisture Scatter Radio Networking with Low Power



In this repo, a low-cost (6 Euro per sensor), low-power (in the order of 200
ÂµW per sensor), with high communication range (in the order
of 250 meter), scatter radio sensor network is presented, for soil
moisture monitoring at multiple locations. The proposed network
utilizes analog frequency modulation (FM) in a bistatic network
architecture (i.e., the emitter and reader are not co-located), while
the sensors operate simultaneously, using frequency division
multiple access (FDMA). In contrast to prior art, this work
utilizes an ultra-low cost software-defined radio reader, offers
custom microstrip capacitive sensing with simple calibration, as
well as modulation pulses for each scatter radio sensor with
50% duty cycle; the latter is necessary for scalable network
designs. Overall root mean squared error (RMSE) below 1%
is observed, even for ranges of 250 m. This is another small (but
concrete) step for the adoption of scatter radio technology as a
key enabling technology for scalable, large-scale, low-power and
cost environmental sensor networking.
